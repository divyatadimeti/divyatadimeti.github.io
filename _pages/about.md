Hi! I’m Divya, a senior at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science and Linguistics. I’m broadly interested in natural and spoken language processing, and I care deeply about the inclusivity and accessibility of language technologies.

I’m currently building deep learning models for audio classification as an intern at [Deepgram](https://deepgram.com/).

I am also an avid golfer and long-time violinist. In my free time, you’ll find me at the driving range, busking with friends, or trying a new vegetarian sushi restaurant.

Let’s connect!
